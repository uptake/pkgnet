## Introduction

`pkgnet` is an R library designed for the analysis of R libraries! The goal of the package is to build a graph representation of a package and its dependencies to inform a variety of activities, including:

- prioritizing functions to unit test based on their centrality
- examining the recursive dependencies you are taking on by using a given package
- exploring the structure of a new package provided by a coworker or downloaded from the internet
