### CRAN Response/Discussion on April 1st, 2020

CRAN robot: Does not pass tests

Me: This one note is the maintainer email change I mentioned in the submission note.  This is fine.  Please upload. 

CRAN person: But the problem is: "Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index." Please fix and resubmit.

Me: Is it possible to proceed with that as is?  I would like to use vignettes to build the website articles but not host them on CRAN (because issues).  It would be easier if I could keep the DESCRIPTION file the same for both processes. 

CRAN person: No, if you have the field all our checks assume there is also a vignette.

### Resubmission on April 2nd, 2020

This is a third submission for version 0.4.1 of pkgnet.  It corrects the issue with the "VignetteBuilder" field in the DESCRIPTION file. 

As always, issues are tracked and source code is maintained at https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet.  This is a patch release that includes a number of bug fixes and minor backwards compatible changes.  Please see `NEWS.md` for details.

## v 0.4.0

### Submission on April 1st, 2019
This is a minor release that adds vignette creation functionality and makes a number of other minor changes and bug fixes.  Please see `NEWS.md` for details.

As always, issues are tracked and source code is maintained at https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet.

### CRAN Response on April 2nd, 2019
Thanks, we see:

   Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
   ...
   [two in the CreatePackageVignette()]
   [one in NEWS.md]
   ...

Please fix and resubmit.


Is there some reference about the method you can add in the Description 
field in the form Authors (year) <doi:.....>?

### Resubmission on April 5th, 2019
The one remaining "possibly invalid URL" is intended.  That page will be created as soon as this version is on CRAN.  [Here](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/blob/929b2c3ee456870dd92e6a164f858a2b014c5e89/docs/articles/publishing-reports.html) it is queued up on github, awaiting CRAN release before merge. 

The two were non-canonical CRAN links have been reformatted.  I had seen the warnings for the non-canonical CRAN links during testing and had interpreted them as optional.  In future testing, these CRAN link formatting warnings will be interpreted as required. 

Regarding the references comment, the package is original work aside from the functionality utilized from the packages listed in the DESCRIPTION file. 

## v 0.3.2 

### Submission on January 25th, 2019
Discovery and correction of a critical bug in the creation of table data in the package report necessitates this minor version upgrade.  As always, source code and issue tracking is available at https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet.

Specifically, here are the changes:  

CHANGES  
* Added unit tests for network measure calculations ([#166](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/pull/166)).   
* Revised unit test setup and teardown files to enable devtools::test() to work as well as CRAN server testing ([#167](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/pull/167))   

BUG FIXES  
* Corrected node statistics table merging error ([#165](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/issues/165), [#166](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/pull/166))   
* Added a NAMESPACE entry for knitr to suppress warning on CRAN server checks ([#168](https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet/pull/168))   


## v 0.3.1

### CRAN Notification on January 6th, 2019
>Dear maintainer,
>
>Please see the problems shown on the pkgnet check test results page. 
>
>Please correct before 2019-01-20 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

### Submission on January 19th, 2019
>The following change should correct the errors incurred on CRAN's testing infrastructure.  These errors stem from the inherent need of this package to test itself on toy packages of a known structure. The authors have gone to great lengths to remain in compliance with all CRAN policies and conduct testing within a temporary directory.  However, despite no issues locally or via the automated TRAVIS checks of pull requests, the creation and later referencing of temporary directories on CRAN's testing infrastructure remains troublesome. 

>As unit testing is at the discretion of the package authors, we choose to have TRAVIS remain the main vehicle for automated unit testing for this package.  Of course, all other tests of package integrity on CRAN will continue, just not custom unit testing. 

>As always, tests and source code are maintained at https://github.com/uptake/pkgnet

>Sincerely, 

>Brian Burns

### Resubmission on January 2nd, 2019
>Hello, 
>
>I hope you had a refreshing holiday break. 
>
>Apologies for the past issues with this build.  I believe we have remedied the functionality that did not pass i386 tests.  However, I cannot confirm this as the last submission alsopassed R CMD check on R-devel without issue.  Is there a separate docker container I can use to check i386 compatibility?   
>
>This submission passes R CMD check tests on r-devel with two warnings regarding URLs that fail within the container but have been confirmed valid and pass on R CMD check on R-core outside the container. 
>
>Here is the version info: 
```
> RD CMD check --as-cran pkgnet_0.3.0.tar.gz
* using log directory ‘/RPackage/pkgnet.Rcheck’
* using R Under development (unstable) (2018-12-21 r75875)
* using platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
